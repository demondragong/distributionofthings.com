Talent aside, the short answer is yes. But you might have to be strategic when selecting your sport. For instance, if you’re eyeing swimming, you'd be considered an outlier after the age of 30, as the majority of swimmers are younger than that. The data shows that 75% of swimmers are under 23 years, with the range tightening around the lower 20s.

On the other hand, equestrian athletes offer a much different picture. 75% of these athletes are over 30 years, with some even competing well into their 50s and 60s. This suggests that excelling in equestrian sports requires experience, likely built over decades of training and competition.

There’s also variance within sports. Take athletics, for example. When we compare the shortest and longest distances, we notice that sprinters tend to be younger, while endurance athletes, particularly in marathons, tend to be older. The same can be said for swimming—athletes competing in shorter distances tend to be younger than those in longer, endurance-based events.
